# ChatApplication
This project will seek to develop a high-end, all encompassing and exhaustive social media chatting app-that not only allows users to seamlessly communicate with friends and family-but also, with the use of a friendly UI design, that is simple to learn and master; will allow the app to be used by a much wider demographic (as compared to some of the social media apps used today).
The project seeks to construct a simple, prototype of a chatting application and while doing so-provide a study on the various inconsistencies and restrictions-established telecommunication-services and social media apps enforce upon their target demographic and users.

## Some snapshots of the application:
